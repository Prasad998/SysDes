üé• **Watch:** [Exponent -YT](https://youtu.be/L9TfZdODuFQ?si=M8lI5aTCSEZZRwrV)

---

## 1. Define the Problem Space

- Understand the problem and define its scope.
- Clarify **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.
- State **assumptions** and **decisions** clearly and explicitly.

---

## 2. Design the System at a High Level

- Design **APIs** to define how clients access system resources.
- Consider request parameters, response types, and **client-server communication**.
- Create a **high-level design diagram** to represent system architecture.

---

## 3. Deep Dive into the Design

- Analyze system **components** and their **interactions** in depth.
- Evaluate how **non-functional requirements** influence design decisions.
- Present **design alternatives** with their **pros and cons**.

---

## 4. Identify Bottlenecks and Scaling Opportunities

- Evaluate how the system performs under **varied conditions** and **growth**.
- Identify and address:
  - **Single points of failure**
  - **Data replication**
  - **Global availability**
  - **Scalability**

- Techniques to consider:
  - **Horizontal sharding**
  - **CDN**
  - **Caching**
  - **Rate limiting**
  - **Database design**

---

## 5. Review and Wrap Up

- Summarize key decisions with **justifications** and **trade-offs**.
- Ensure the design meets all stated requirements.
- Suggest **potential improvements** and **future directions**.
