1. *Define the Problem Space:*
     - Understand problem and define scope.
     - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements.
     - State assumptions and decisions explicitly.

  2. *Design the System at a High Level:*
     - Design APIs to define how clients access system resources.
     - Consider request parameters, response types, and communication between client and server.
     - Create a high-level design diagram to illustrate system architecture.

  3. *Deep Dive into the Design:*
     - Examine system components and relationships in detail.
     - Consider non-functional requirements' impact on design choices.
     - Present different design options with pros and cons.

  4. *Identify Bottlenecks and Scaling Opportunities:*
     - Assess system's ability to operate under various conditions and support growth.
     - Address single points of failure, data replication, global service support, and scalability.
     - Consider concepts like horizontal sharding, CDN, caching, rate limiting, and databases.

  5. *Review and Wrap Up:*
     - Summarize major decisions with justifications and trade-offs.
     - Ensure design satisfies all requirements.
     - Identify directions for further improvement.
