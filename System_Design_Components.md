## Basic System Requirements:
- **Database** – For data persistence.
- **Server**   – Enables API-driven architecture and scalability.
- **Network**  – Facilitates communication between client, server, and database.

**Not Essential:**

- **Frontend** – Optional; can use CLI or curl.
- **Load balancers, caches** – Needed only for high scalability and performance, not for basic setups.


**Logial Entities**

- 🖥️ **Server** – Handles requests, supports APIs, and allows scalability.  
- 🌐 **Network** – Connects client ↔ server ↔ database.

## 🚫 Not Essential (For Basic Systems):
- 🧑‍💻 **Frontend** – Optional; CLI or curl can be enough.  
- ⚖️ **Load Balancer**, 🧠 **Cache** – Useful for scaling/performance, but not needed at the start.
